# Review Log File Locations

# In addition to various logs files and command output, you can use journalctl to view logs from the node perspective.
# We will view common locations of log files, then a command to view container logs. There are other logging options,
# such as the use of a sidecar container dedicated to loading the logs of another container in a pod.
# Whole cluster logging is not yet available with Kubernetes. Outside software is typically used, such as Fluentd, part of
# http://fluentd.org/, which is another member project of CNCF.io, like Kubernetes.

# If using a systemd.based Kubernetes cluster, view the node level logs for kubelet, the local Kubernetes agent. Each
# node will have different contents as this is node specific
journalctl -u kubelet |less

# Major Kubernetes processes now run in containers. You can view them from the container or the pod perspective. Use
# the find command to locate the kube-apiserver log. Your output will be different, but will be very long.
sudo find / -name "*apiserver*log"

# Take a look at the log file.
sudo less /var/log/containers/kube-apiserver-cp_kube-system_kube-apiserver-<ID>.log

# Search for and review other log files for coredns, kube-proxy, and other cluster agents.

# If not on a Kubernetes cluster using systemd which collects logs via journalctl you can view the text files on the cp node.
# (a) /var/log/kube-apiserver.log
# Responsible for serving the API
# (b) /var/log/kube-scheduler.log
# Responsible for making scheduling decisions
# (c) /var/log/kube-controller-manager.log
# Controller that manages replication controllers

# /var/log/containers
# Various container logs

# /var/log/pods/
# More log files for current Pods.

# Worker Nodes Files (on non-systemd systems)
# (a) /var/log/kubelet.log
# Responsible for running containers on the node
# (b) /var/log/kube-proxy.log
# Responsible for service load balancing
